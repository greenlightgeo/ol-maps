                to fully view the map toolbar and for better overall viewing of the map and this welcome page.
                Also, it is recommended that you try this map on a tablet or laptop for better performance and visualization, 
                as the map toolbar provides dynamic zoom and animation for exploring the historic map. <br>
                <h4>Here are the tools you can use to explore the map:</h4>
